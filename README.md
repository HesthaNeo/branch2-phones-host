<h1><u>Milestone 12: Branch 2 Phones & Hosts</u></h1>
    <p>Eleventh phase, we will install Cisco CP-7960 VoIP phones and connect host computers for testing. The Branch 2 VoIP Phones will connect via the HQ Voice Router as no voice services are configured on the Branch 2 router..</p>
    <h2><strong><u>Configuration Steps</u></strong></h2>
    <p><b>Step 1: Connect Two Cisco 7960 VoIP Phones To The Branch 1 Access Switch</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 2: Access The Branch 1 Router CLI And View The DHCP Bindings For Each Phone, Obtaining The MAC-Address Of Each Phone</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 3: On The Branch 1 Voice Router Configure The Two Ephones That Were Just Connected</b></p>
        <p>- A. Ephone 1, Ephone 2</p>
        <p>- B. MAC-Address</p>
        <p>- C. Phone Type</p>
        <p>- D. Button 1</p>
    <p><b>Step 4: Test Dialing By Extension Between Each Branch Phone And To The HQ Phones</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 5: Test Outbound Dialing To The PSTN Test Phone 8885551111</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 6: Test Inbound Dialing To B1 External Phone Number(s) <em>(Lab Configuration Not Supported)</em></b></p>
    <p><b>Step 7: Connect A Host Directly To Each Of The Two Cisco 7960 VoIP Phones That Were Just Connected To The Network</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 8: Test Each Host By Pinging Around The Branch 1 Network From Each Host, Between Each Host And To The Headquarters Network And PCs</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 9: Test IP Connectivity To The Internet By Pinging Google Server 8.8.8.8</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 10: Test DNS And Website Connectivity By Using The Web Browser On Each Host To Access Www.Google.Com</b></p>
    <p><b>Step 11: Install And Configure Corporate Wireless Access</b></p>
        <p>- A. Install An AccessPoint-PT And Connect It To The Branch 1 Access Switch</p>
        <p>- B. Configure The New AP With A uUnique SSID, Channel, And Passphrase Using WPA2-PSK And AES</p>
        <p>- C. Install Two Wireless Tablets And Configure Them With The Same SSID And Passphrase</p>
        <p>- D. Once The New Wireless Tablets Are Connected Confirm Access To The Corporate Networks And Internet</p>
